# Surfs-Up
## Overview
The purpose of this project was to use a sqlite data base and extract the weather in Oahu for the months of June and December.  This data will be used to determine the viability of a year round Surf and Shake Shop.

## Results

- As expected the average weather in June is higher then in December, but not by much.
-The average temp in June is 74.9 and the average temp in December is 71.
- December has a higher standard deviation then June.  This means that there is likely more fluctuation in temperatre.
- The temperature in June stays between 64 and 85 degrees.  This is a smaller range then what is seen in December, it ranges between 56 and 83.

## Summary
Based on the minimal difference in average tempreature between June and December, it would be fair to say that business would probably do well all year.  With averages in the 70s it is likely that people would want to surf and have ice cream.  In December there are days where it could get as low as 56 so the winter month will probably not be as profitable but there should be enough nice day to make it though to high season.  

Additionaly, it would be interesting to find out the percipitation levels in both those month.  Rain would likely have an impact on business. It would also be good to look at humidity. Humidity can greatly change the feel of the outdoors even if the temps are the same.  The Surt and Shake Shop would relly on customers wanting to be outside so it is very important to look at all posible factors.
